### Glad to see you here! &nbsp; ![visitors](https://visitor-badge.laobi.icu/badge?page_id=isuk4s4.isuk4s4)

As an Offensive Security Specialist and Technology Enthusiast, I spend my time breaking, building, and learning. I actively engage in web exploitation, network penetration testing, and developing offensive security tools while playing Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions to sharpen my hacking skills. I am always experimenting with new programming languages and diving into hardware hacking with tools like Arduino and Raspberry Pi. Always on the lookout for the next challenge to push my limits! 💡
